    <p>My future business 

        I would like to own a car manufacturing company in my country.
        My model is Elune musk. Who is the owner of Tesla company? 
        I know this is a very big and a challenged plan. Especially if youâ€™re investing in a country with limited infrastructure and limited resources. 
        My strategy would be to start with the manufacturing spare parts, for existing cars and grow financially.
        Below are the departments that I would like to exist in my company.

   <h2> 1, IT department</h2><br>
