    <h1>Stroy of my life</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>My name is Yohana Oqubaldet living in Oakland CA. I am originally from Eritrean, and I was born on the 27th of July 1993. 
      Back in Eritrea I graduated from an Engineering college that is so called EIT (ERITREAN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY). 
      And I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from that college.

      Me coming to the US was intended for one thing and that is serving myself a better education with the American standard of education.
       And Maharishi International University is one that serves my purpose. I have my reasons for choosing Maharishi International University. 
       One is that Eritrea meets a lower background educational curriculum. And because of that reason I miss a lot of programming languages that I should have covered.
      Of course, I did the basics in java, c, c++, RDBMS and so on, but they were not good enough for me. Taking it as a sample is JavaScript.
       Generally, these days JavaScript is popular because on the server, JavaScript can be integrated with other languages to communicate with databases. 
       Of course, I know it but I could not get any deeper due to lack of internet and other resources and I can see that MIU is providing me that. 
       Being a full stack developer (backend developer) is what I always dream of since I got into the field of Computer Engineering because itâ€™s so dynamic that I can always learn new things while enjoying working from it. 
       And again, I feel like MIU is going to provide me that. In addition to that I enjoy anything that has to do with graphics and designing.
      
      Right now, I am taking my classes online my professor is in India.
       I am glad I found a very hamble professor which really encourage us to being familiar with the new technology especially in programming language. 
       Being a master's degree graduate in computer science what I have been dreaming and I feel like I can get that at MIU.
